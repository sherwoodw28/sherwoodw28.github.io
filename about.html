                <h2 id="about-text-chunk">Iâ€™m an aspiring Software Developer, having just completed A-Levels in Computer Science, Engineering and Maths.  Since 2021, I have been interested in exploring the subject of Computer Science, with a particular focus on Programming. I have developed a proficient knowledge of Python, as well as exploring other programming languages, such as C#. I also have experience working with some web technologies, such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well as briefly working with SQL.</h3>
                <h2 id="about-text-chunk">From a young age, I have loved working with IT and Technology in various areas, including 3D CAD and Design, Visual Effects, and eventually Programming. My love for video games has played a massive impact on my life, growing up with personal favourites like Outer Wilds and Horizon Zero Dawn, they both sparked a love for problem solving and technology in their stories they told, but also on a technical level got me wondering what a product like those looked like behind the scenes fascinated me.</h3>
                <h2 id="about-text-chunk">Beyond my A-Levels, I hope to move forward into the Technology Industry in some form, aiming to take part in a Degree Apprenticeship or gain a Computer Science Degree. Without a clear focus of interest right now, and the ever-changing landscape of the technological world, I am open to exploring as many opportunities and areas of Computer Science I can experience, always hoping to learn new things and grow as a developer and as a person.</h3>
